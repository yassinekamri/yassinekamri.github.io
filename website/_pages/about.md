Hi, I’m a researcher in applied mathematics and computer science. I recently completed my PhD in the [Mathematical Engineering Department](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/inma) at UCLouvain under the supervision of Prof. [François Glineur](https://perso.uclouvain.be/francois.glineur/) and Prof. [Julien Hendrickx](https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/). My doctoral work was funded by the European Union’s MARIE SKŁODOWSKA-CURIE training network [TraDE-OPT](https://trade-opt-itn.eu/).  

Before that, I earned an engineering degree from CentraleSupélec and a Master of Science in Mathematics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning [(Master MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) from the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.  

During my PhD, my research focused on mathematical optimization, in particular the analysis and design of first-order algorithms. I worked with [Performance Estimation Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05666), a computer-assisted framework for the worst-case analysis of first-order methods.  

The manuscript of my thesis is available [here](http://dial.uclouvain.be/handle/boreal:303997).
